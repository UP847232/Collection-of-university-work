		<h1> Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web </h1>
		<article id="introduction">
			<p> There have been many studies that have investigated the exposure of personal information online,
			with each of these studies having addressed different perspectives of how such information
			exposure occurs. Some studies argue that the demand for increased complexity and security
			standards for passwords present the greatest risk (Grant, 2011; Fleishman, 2015). Other studies
			claim that the privacy practices of social networking sites pose a greater risk (Steijn, Schouten,
			Vedder, 2016; Zhang, Li, Luo, Warkentin, 2017), whilst a collection of studies claim that user
			mentality and interpretation of privacy creates the greatest risk (Hann, Hui, Lee, Png, 2007). </p>

			<h2> Passwords </h2>
			<p> Fleishman’s (2015) article addresses a number of flaws that permit ease of access for hackers and
			crackers into a person’s account. These issues include the inaccuracy of password strength
			indicators, for which Fleishman states provide a false indication as to the strength of a person’s
			password, which in turn deludes the user into believing that their chosen password is strong and
			difficult to hack. </p>
			<p> Fleishman (2015) additionally addresses the consistent necessity by users to repeatedly use the
			same passwords for multiple websites and other areas of authorisation access. This point is also
			addressed in Grant’s article, whereby Grant states that the demand for users to memorise longer,
			more complex passwords puts too heavy a burden on the users, which in turn results in users
			reusing a handful of easy to remember passwords (Grant, p.80). Both Fleishman and Grant state that
			this mentality morphs users into ideal targets for hacking and personal information exposure. </p>
			<p> Irani, Webb, Pu and Li (2011, p.14) also address flaws with online password security systems,
			stipulating that security questions allow attackers to easily acquire access to a user‘s online account
			via password-recovery attacks. Once access as been achived attackers can then data mine to further
			gain access to other accounts held by the user. </p>

			<h2> Social Networking Sites </h2>
			<p> Many studies pertaining to the exposure of information via social networking sites vary in terms of
			the focus of what is deemed the most imperative factor. An article by Marreiros, Schraefel, Tonin
			and Vlassopoulos (2017) states a number of factors that may lead to personal information exposure
			through the use of social networking sites. </p>
			<p> One such factor that is addressed is the incentive for users to share personal information, a view
			which is equally shared by Steijn, Schouten and Vedder (2016), as well as Irani, Webb, Pu and Li. All
			three articles agree that users are incentivised to share personal information, as providing accurate
			information permits more effcient networking (Irani et al, 2011, p.13), as well as provide users with
			tangible, personal and social benefits (steijn et al, 2016, p.2). Though in addition the articles also
			state that this makes users vulnerable privacy risks, that could range from an excessive volume of
			ads to identity theft (Marreiros et al, 2017, p.2).</p>
			<p> Steijn et alia (2016, p.3) article also states that users of social networking sites possess a high
			likelyhood for sharing personal information online, compared to non-users, whom where deemed to
			possess a higher level of risk adversion. </p>
			<p> An article writen by Zhang, Li, Luo and Warkentin (2017, p.956) states that user satisfaction is
			directly related to a user’s willingness to divulge personal information. Users that are highly satisfied
			with the privacy practices of social networking sites are more likely to divulge information, as
			opposed to those with low satisfaction. </p>

			<h2> User Mentality and Interpretation of Privacy </h2>
			<p> Studies that address the concept of user mentality and interpretation in terms of personal
			information exposure vary in their approach. The article by steijn et alia (2016, p.4) states that the
			user’s age affects their interpretation of privacy, as well as the type of threats they are exposed to.
			The article states that younger users take a more liberal approach to privacy, compared to older
			users. This difference is noted as being a direct result of the concerns that older users possess, as
			opposed to the concerns of younger users. The threats to information exposure for older users tend
			to relate to financial, employment and other mature aspects of life. </p>
			<p> An article by Cameron, Salazar, Bernhardt, Burgess-Whitman, Wingood and DiClemente (2005, p536)
			states persons are more likely to disclose sensitive information in online group chats, as opposed to
			face-to-face group interactions. This is noted as being due to the idea of a user possessing anonymity
			when online, as opposed to being exposed in a face-to-face environment. </p>
			<p> A matter addressed in Marreiros et alia (2017, p.2) article focuses on user interactions with the
			terms and conditions of certain websites. The article states that many users fail to inform
			themselves by neglecting to read the terms and conditions, and instead choose to automatically
			agree to the terms. The article continues by suggesting that the reason may be, because many users
			find the terms and conditions to be overly time-consuming and difficult to comprehend. </p>
			<p> Marreiros et alia (2017, p.2) article also state that user concerns for privacy and likelihood for
			sharing information are partially determined by bounded rationality and behavioural biases, ideas
			similar to those presented in the article by Hann, Hui, Lee and Png. The article by Hann et alia (2007,
			p.2) divides users into one of three types of online user; “privacy guardians, information sellers, and
			convenience seekers”, with each of the three types of user prioritising privacy, monetary rewards
			and convenience respectfully (p.18). </p>

			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p> In conclusion the purpose of this review was to review a selection of literature relating to the
			mitigation of personal information exposure on the web.
			Reviewing of these literature pieces has expressed a varying focus on the impending factors that
			affect personal information exposure for online users. This review has covered the impact of
			passwords and password security, social networking sites and the mentality and interpretation of
			privacy of users. </p>
